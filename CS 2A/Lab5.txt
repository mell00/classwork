Compiler errors

Part 1

1. Answer 1 for Part 1:

Visual Studio 2019

2. Answer 2 for Part 1:

In function 'int main(int, const char**)':
28:5: error: expected ';' before 'name'

3. Answer 3 for Part 1:

The error message appears on line 28 of the code.


Put this code, which contains the same bug, into the online editor cpp.sh:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {
    string greeting;
    string name;
    greeting = "Hello"
    name = "everyone";
    cout << greeting << ", " << name << endl;
    return 0;
}

4. Answer 4 for Part 1:

In function 'int main(int, const char**)':
8:5: error: expected ';' before 'name'

5. Answer 5 for Part 1:

The message appears on the 8th line of code.

6. Answer 6 for Part 1:

No. The problem appears on the 7th line of code.

7. Answer 7 for Part 1:

To fix the problem, add a semicolon to the end of the 7th line of code.

8. Answer 8 for Part 1:

The error messages are unclear as they indicate a different line of code from where the
problem is actually located.


Part 2

1. Answer 1 for Part 2:

117:5: error: expected unqualified-id before 'return'
119:1: error: expected declaration before '}' token

2. Answer 2 for Part 2:

The messages appear on the 117th and 119th lines of code.

3. Answer 3 for Part 2:

On the 37th line of code, there exists a space between the first closing brace and the last
three closing braces.

4. Answer 4 for Part 2:

The 37th line of code contains an extra closing brace.

5. Answer 5 for Part 2:

No; the error does not appear on line 37.

6. Answer 6 for Part 2:

The use of autocomplete and delimiter highlighting could have prevented the bug.


Part 3

1. Answer 1 for Part 3:

In function 'int main(int, const char**)':
48:37: error: 'numHamsters' was not declared in this scope

2. Answer 2 for Part 3:

http://www.cplusplus.com/forum/beginner/186678/

3. Answer 3 for Part 3:

The variable 'numHamsters' is referenced on line 48, but was never declared and assigned
a value in the first place. Assigning values at the points of declaration of the 'numDogs' and
'numCats' variables, as shown with the 'numParrots' variable, more efficiently organizes the
code and may have made it more obvious that a similar statement does not exist for 'numHamsters'.


Part 4

I already declared a variable to hold the student ID number, but the compiler says this variable is not
declared. From the module about this (Debugging: Finding and eliminating bugs), the compiler errors section
addresses this very common error. What does it suggest we can do if we canâ€™t see a problem with an undeclared
variable?

1. Answer 1 for Part 4:

The debugging module suggests copying and pasting the variable from a declaration and comparing
it to the undeclared identifier referenced in the compiler message to check for spelling errors.
